# Snake Game
# Introduction
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game in Python. The goal is to control a snake on a grid, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The game features dynamic scoring and simple controls, demonstrating proficiency in game development and programming.

# How to Play:

python game_display.py

Control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard:
Up Arrow → Move up
Down Arrow → Move down
Left Arrow → Move left

The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing area.
